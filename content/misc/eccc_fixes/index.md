## The Problems

1. ECCC has an annoying habit of downloading reports to your computer instead of opening them in the browser.
2. The ECCC report upload page has a bug whenever you enter a space in a coauthor's name that causes the entire page to crash.

## The Solution

ECCC Fixes is a browser extension available for both Chrome-based browsers and for Firefox. You can find the extensions and more details about it (including the source code) [over here](https://github.com/suhailsherif/eccc-fixes).
