[Fine Design](https://www.youtube.com/finedesignvideos) (turns out you can't change the name of a channel once you create it) was a result of me trying out Grant Sanderson's amazing [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) library for mathematics-related animations. Thanks to that I ended up making a bunch of videos about topics that I considered layman-accessible but that I couldn't find on YouTube. Here's a list of topics covered.

  - A couple of hat puzzles that I really liked for their basic yet insightful impossibility proofs, and for the impressive possibility results that follow. {{< cta cta_alt_text="Watch the playlist" cta_alt_link="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-R4p-BRL8NQnZJw_5WTn3Ta5ry3jGyhM" cta_alt_new_tab="true" >}}

  - A series on the BIGNUM BAKEOFF contest, where contestants had to submit $512$-character C codes and the code that returns the largest number (when run on a hypothetical computer with arbitrarily large ints) wins. It touches a lot of topics in theoretical computer science and mathematical logic. {{< cta cta_alt_text="Watch the playlist" cta_alt_link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1K6TOy6yjU&list=PL-R4p-BRL8NR8THgjx_DW9c92VHTtjZEY&index=1" cta_alt_new_tab="true" >}}

  - A video on non-adaptive combinatorial group testing. It goes over how polynomials were used by some researchers to test people for covid with far fewer tests performed than the number of people tested. {{< cta cta_alt_text="Watch the video" cta_alt_link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4wFd3iARWA" cta_alt_new_tab="true" >}}

  - A video on the Graham-Pollak Theorem and how the proof of such a combinatorial statement is so "non-combinatorial". {{< cta cta_alt_text="Watch the video" cta_alt_link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ByCnuCbPsg" cta_alt_new_tab="true" >}}

  - A series on Markov's Theorem (the one that bounds the maximum slope of a degree $d$ polynomial that is bounded in an interval). There's a fascinating proof that I've tried to present. {{< cta cta_alt_text="Watch the playlist" cta_alt_link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pPS8Me_iFw&list=PL-R4p-BRL8NRjpfJ7X8U1fsLjgrejieDI&index=1" cta_alt_new_tab="true" >}}

  - A series on quantum brute-force password checking, with an upper bound from Grover's algorithm and a matching lower bound from Markov's theorem. {{< cta cta_alt_text="Watch the playlist" cta_alt_link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhGQQ4fLXX0&list=PL-R4p-BRL8NSCoZAsClRd-fz0_IJ1am0C" cta_alt_new_tab="true" >}}

  - If you're allowed to change a number $N$ in base $10$ by adding plus signs in the middle, (i.e. $15243 \\to 1+5+24+3 = 32$ is a valid step), then as $N \\to \\infty$, how many steps would you need to reach a single-digit number? $O(\log^*N)$ is easy to prove, but can you show a better upper bound? {{< cta cta_alt_text="Watch the video" cta_alt_link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQIEY7eVwLo" cta_alt_new_tab="true" >}}
